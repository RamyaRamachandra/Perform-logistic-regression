# Perform-logistic-regression

#### Introduction
In this activity, you will complete an effective bionomial logistic regression. This exercise will help you better understand the value of using logistic regression to make predictions for a dependent variable based on one independent variable and help you build confidence in practicing logistic regression. Because logistic regression is leveraged across a wide array of industries, becoming proficient in this process will help you expand your skill set in a widely-applicable way.

For this activity, you work as a consultant for an airline. The airline is interested in knowing if a better in-flight entertainment experience leads to higher customer satisfaction. They would like you to construct and evaluate a model that predicts whether a future customer would be satisfied with their services given previous customer feedback about their flight experience.

The data for this activity is for a sample size of 129,880 customers. It includes data points such as class, flight distance, and in-flight entertainment, among others. Your goal will be to utilize a binomial logistic regression model to help the airline model and better understand this data.

Because this activity uses a dataset from the industry, you will need to conduct basic EDA, data cleaning, and other manipulations to prepare the data for modeling.

In this activity, you will practice the following skills:

* Importing packages and loading data
* Exploring the data and completing the cleaning process
* Building a binomial logistic regression model
* Evaluating a binomial logistic regression model using a confusion matrix
